<h1>Theme Tussle</h1>

<h3><em>By Jake Soucy</em></h3>

<hr />

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Theme Tussle is a 2D fighting game made for true fighting game enthusiasts. All characters in the game are stylized around movie themes. The player controls a character they select and heads out to battle against other characters. The matches will be put under a timer, and the idea is to lower your opponent's health bar to 0 to achieve victory. If your health bar were to reach 0, you would lose.  </p>

<h2>Game Description</h2>

<hr />

<ul>
<li><h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The game itself shall contain an Arcade Mode, which will be three consecutive battles with a general narrative that depends on the character; a Tutorial Mode, which will show the player how the game is played and will explain the rules; A Versus Mode, which will be a single match that can be played against a computer or even a friend, making the game multiplayer, and finally, a settings option to customize input buttons and volume. The main quest follows Nina, a cowgirl trying to find their bounty. </p></li>
<li><h3>The Quest</h3>

<p>The quest is tied into the Arcade Mode. The story is told between all three consecutive battles, separated into different levels. The main story is as follows. Our main character, Nina, is trying to find their bounty and runs into other characters along the way. In the first level, Nina meets up with another bounty hunter, an energetic thief named Suzie and learning that they both have the same target, they duke it out. In the second level, Nina overhears two spiders whispering evil plans and gets caught by a dramatic spider king named Leo. After getting information from the king, Nina tracks down her bounty, Charlie, a rogue jester causing chaos.  If the player succeeds in this Arcade Mode for the first time, they receive a new colour for Nina.</p></li>
<li><h3>Main Character</h3>

<p>The main character is a girl from the West called <strong>Nina</strong>. She’s a bounty hunter with a love for money and adventures.  She’s a sassy woman who won’t hesitate to say what’s on her mind.  Her playstyle is an in-your-face character with many weapons, such as a rope, a boomerang, and her trusty pistol. Her goal in this game is to catch her bounty, Charlie. </p></li>

<li><h3>Opponents</h3>

<p>Three characters are considered opponents in this game:</p>

<p><strong>Suzie</strong> is a thief who dreams of robbing someone of high authority, claiming their riches as her own.  She is a quick and stealthy character who attacks with a dagger and ninja stars. Her health bar is much smaller than that of other characters, but don’t let that fool you; her speed makes up for it.</p>

<p><strong>Leo</strong>, King of Spiders, is a huge man who commands spiders to attack his opponents. He wants to get rid of anyone who opposes him. His size makes him easier to hit, but his bigger health bar makes him a scary opponent. </p>

<p><strong>Charlie</strong> is a rogue jester who dislikes responsibilities and wants to spread smiles and laughs worldwide. Unfortunately, her methods are poorly thought out, as they hurt people more than help. Their playstyle is unpredictable as they can throw an assortment of random objects that all fulfill different tasks. </p></li>

<li><h3>Environment</h3>

<p>Every character has an area that is classified as their Scene. Scenes contain characters that match the theme, so vampires and ghouls can be seen on a horror level. The Stages include:</p>

<p>The Wild West is a western land with a saloon and several old-timey buildings in the background. </p>

<p>A rundown village with broken homes and a general empty theme.</p>

<p>The outside of a dark castle which is connected to a bridge. The land seems very well taken care of. </p>

<p>A void-like whitespace that will sometimes switch to a different colour. Floating objects can be seen everywhere.</p></li>

<li><h3>Menus</h3>

<p>The Main Menu will include the following in the exact order. An Arcade Mode, a Tutorial Mode, a Versus Mode, an Options button, and a Quit Game button. The Options tab in the Main Menu will include a Button Settings tab and a Sound Options tab. The Pause button will be the same as the Options tab but with the addition of a Leave Battle button and a Quit Game button. The Arcade Menu and Versus Mode will include a Character Select Menu that shows all four characters and changeable colours. </p></li>
<li><h3>Controls</h3>

<p>Theme Tussle will contain three separate attack buttons that tie in with motion inputs to create a myriad of possible attacks performed by a character selected by the player. ASWD are the motion inputs for Player 1. A goes to the left, D to the right, S will make the player crouch, and W will make the player jump. Going the opposite direction you are facing will make you block incoming attacks. There are two versions of blocking: low blocking moves block low attacks, and standard blocking blocks high attacks. Pressing the forward button twice will allow you to run. Attack buttons include I, light attacks; O, medium attacks; and P, heavy attacks. </p></li>
<li><h3>Sounds</h3>

<p>All characters will have voice lines for some of their moves. Some attacks will dish out powerful sounds. Every character will have their music that corresponds to their genre. Nina will have a more Western-inspired song, while Leo’s will be more horror-inspired. </p></li>
</ul>
